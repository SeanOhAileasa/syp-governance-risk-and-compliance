    "Another set of business policies associated with security would be ``Separation of Duties``. One type of a separation of duty would be a ``Split Knowledge``. That means that one person might have some of the details, and another person would have the other part of the details. You can think of this split knowledge being used with something like a safe combination, where one person might have part of a safe combination and another person would have the other part of the safe combination. Individual users would not be able to open the safe on their own and we would need to gather the knowledge from everyone to have the full combination.\n",

Instead of knowledge of a combination, perhaps the users have keys and to be able to open the safe both users have to turn both keys simultaneously. In that particular case, they would need to be present and that would be dual control. \n",
