    "A detective control type commonly identifies and is able to record that a security event has occurred, but it may not be able to prevent access - if you have a motion detector, it can certainly identify that motion is there, but it’s not able to stop someone from walking through the room. Same thing might apply to an IDS, which is set to alarm or alert if it identifies malicious software on the network but an IDS is designed to only detect that traffic flow and not prevent that traffic flow. \n",

    "> ``Corrective``\n",
    "\n",
    "A corrective control is designed to mitigate any damage that was occurred because of a security event, for example in IPS, intrusion prevention system can identify an attack on the network and block that traffic from entering the rest of the network or devices on your site are infected with ransomware one way to correct that problem, through this corrective control, is to simply restore from a known good backup. On a larger scale if a storms hit and power has gone out, you can move everything over to a backup site and maintain the uptime and availability through that corrective control.\n",

    "> ``Detterant``\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterrent may not stop an intrusion from occurring but it may deter someone from performing an intrusion, for example, if there’s a Warning sign that would let people know that you were watching for any type of problem - there could be a login banner and a sign in page that lets people know that you’re watching for the logins or there might be lights around your building that might deter someone from breaking in.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``Compensating``\n",
    "\n",
    "A compensating control attempts to recover from an intrusion by compensating for the issues that were left behind, for example, if someone stole a laptop with all of our data, we could compensate for that by purchasing a new laptop and restoring that data from backup - if someone cut the power to our data center, we could have backup power systems or generators that would compensate for that lack of power.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``Physical``\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical control type is something we would have in the real world that would prevent the security event, something like a fence or a door lock would certainly prevent someone from physically gaining access to our facility."
